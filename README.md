Class and style definitions for homework assignments and exams and their solutions written in latex.

When writing a homework assignment, often times there are mistakes and various edits over time. If you write the solutions in a separate tex file then you will be constantly copying and pasting edits from one file to the other. This package defines a few simple latex environments that make it easy to generate a homework and the accompaning solution from a single tex file. This is a must have if you are a lowly graduate student writing homework problems and solutions.
